### Neugrad
![logo](logo.png "neugrad")

This is a small autograd engine, made purely from numpy and python. This is still a work in progress and more features will be added with time
Hope you have fun implementing this :)

## Requirements to run it

It would help if you had these installed in your system before running this engine
- Numpy
- Typing
- Python (version 3.7+)

## How to run it
- Download all the files (only engine.py)
- Use this syntax `from <file location of engine.py> import NVal` to import it into your code
- You can also see the tests I run on the engine in `test.py`

## Features added till now (with backpropagation)

- Creation of Tensor (NVal)
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Negative of Tensor



### Please keep in mind this is a work in progress and will keep on being updated over time.
