![logo](logo.png "neugrad")

This is a small autograd engine, made purely from numpy and python. This is still a work in progress and morre features will be added with time
Hope you have fun implementing this :)

## Requirements to run it

You need to have these installed in your system before running this engine
- Numpy
- Typing
- Python (version 3.7+)

## How to run it
- Download all the files
- Use this syntax `from <file location of engine.py> import NVal` to import it into your code

## Features added till now (with backpropagation)

- Creation of Tensor (NVal)
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Negative of Tensor



### Please keep in mind this is a work in progress and will keep on being updated over time.
